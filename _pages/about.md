I am a PhD student at the [Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://minghsiehece.usc.edu/) at USC working with [Prof. Murali Annavaram](http://scip-lab.usc.edu/). I obtained my Bachelor’s degree from UC Santa Barbara and my Master's degree from USC. 

My research interests are centered around **efficient LLM fine-tuning and inference**, **cross-device federated learning systems**, and **responsible AI**. Here is a copy of my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_nmI6PbiMfAH85MrOSnA6IIyZP2Sw-k6/view?usp=drive_link).
