I am a PhD student at the [Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://minghsiehece.usc.edu/) at USC working with [Prof. Murali Annavaram](http://scip-lab.usc.edu/). I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s degree from UC Santa Barbara and my Master's degree from USC. 

My research interests are centered around machine learning systems, federated learning, and responsible AI (especially for large language models). Here is a copy of my [CV](https://leigao97.github.io/files/LeiGaoCV.pdf).
